Program-5A:
This program will print information about hidden files in a specified directory. When the program is executed, it will print the file name, size, and the last date of modification.

The program will take in two command line arguments; "Path Name" and "Optional Flag". "Path Name" will be the path of a specified directory and "Optional Flag" will be dictate the structure of how the file information is printed. "Optional Flag" only takes in the flag "-s" and does not require a flag to be entered. If no flag is entered, the order of how the files are printed does not matter. Likewise, if the flag is "-s", the files must be printed in increasing order of the file size.
